PREFACE
In 1939 the Yorkshire Parish Register Society, of which the
Parish Register Section of the Yorkshire Archaeological Society is
the successor (the publications having been issued in numerical
sequence without any break) published as its Volume No. 108 the
entries in the Register of Wensley Parish Church from 1538 to 1700
inclusive. These entries comprised the first 110 pages (and a few lines
of p. lll) of the oldest register at Wensley. The present volume
continues the record down to the end of 1837, in accordance with our
current practice.
The following are particulars of all the register books with
which this volume is concerned; the numbers are those which had
already been marked on the front covers :-
No. 1. Parchment, bound in leather, 12 in. x 8 in. :-
Baptisms & Burials 1538 - 1769
Marriages 1538 - 1754
Entries of all three types intermingled. Pages numbered
(probably in the 17th century) 1 to 318 but some missing, as
I have noted in the appropriate places.
No. 2. Parchment, bound in leather, 13 in. x 8 in. Stamped in gilt,
on a red leather inset on the front cover: 'Wensley Parish
Register 1770' :-

Marriages 1783 - 1792 (but many omissions ; see

follow 65 blank folios, excluding five which have been cut out
at the end of the book.
No. 3. Parchment, ruled and printed in the standard form of the
period, bound in leather, 16% in. x 101} in. :-

entries run into 1807 and, as mentioned under No. 2, above,
the ten years 1783 - 1792 are entered in the earlier volume
although all have been re-entered here, with a number of
additions).
No. 4. The usual Marriage Register of the period, paper, bound in
leather, 151} in. x 10 in. :-
